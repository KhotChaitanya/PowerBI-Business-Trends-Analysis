# PowerBI-Business-Trends-Analysis
This project involves exploring business trends using Microsoft's Power BI tool. The project aims to analyze sales data from the Global Superstore database.


## Project Details
- The project was initiated with an understanding of the Business Intelligence life cycle, the importance of data visualization to the industry, and the need for visualization.
- Power BI was connected to the Global Superstore database to focus on various aspects of the dataset, including sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends.
- The elements of the report window were explored and a variety of visualizations such as column charts, line charts, pie charts, tables, matrices, and more were created.
- Different types of filters were implemented at the visualization, page, and across-page levels. Slicers and advanced filters were also used to refine the data further. The concept of internal (context) filters, internal and external filters were also applied.
- DAX was used to transform data and create new relationships and tables. Measures were created, tables were summarized, and columns in DAX were created to aid in the analysis.
- Dashboard pages were created for navigation and hierarchies were used for drill-down navigation. Interactivity features such as filters, tooltips, and parameters were added to enable users to explore the data in depth.
- Conditional Formatting was applied for many visualizations for rule-based, gradient-based, and field-based formatting.
- A total of 25 requirements were tackled, each designed to test and improve the understanding of different Power BI concepts. These requirements ranged from analyzing sales by country, segment, and market to creating dynamic titles and tooltips.
- Through this project, not only were Power BI skills honed but also a deeper understanding of how to use Power BI for data analysis and business intelligence was gained. The project was a challenging yet rewarding experience that has prepared for handling data-intensive tasks in future roles.
